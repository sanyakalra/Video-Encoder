1. Pre-conditions

The application has been compiled and tested with JDK-9 on Intellij.

The application has been tested on a PC with a RAM of 8 GB.

No other specific hardware peripherals or software is required.

The application only supports encoding of grayscale images upto 100 frames.


2. Supporting files

For the Java PC application, no non-standard libraries have been used.

The application has been tested on a sequence of images sampled from a video. These images are stored in src/Images folder of the project and can be used to test the application. 
To encode your own sequence of images, please delete the exisiting images in src/Images of the project and transfer your images to this folder. 


3. Execution

	a. Clone the project from Bitbucket.
	   https://rdarbha@agile.bu.edu/bitbucket/scm/ec504-pr/ec504projectgroup13.git

	b. Open the VideoEncoder project in Intellij.
	
	c. Store the images to be encoded in 'src/Images' of the project.
	
	d. Set the epsilon in VideoEncoderMain class to a suitable value. High epsilon value yields poorer quality video with better compression as compared to a low epsilon value.
	
	d. Click on Run and then Edit Configurations.
	
	e. Select VideoEncoderMain as the Main class. Make sure to select JDK-9 under JRE field.
	
	f. Provide program arguments as given below and then click on OK.
		i. 	To encode the images :
				encode [file1] [file2] [file3] ... [filen] --output [outputfile], where number of files is less than or equal to 100.
		ii.	To video the video :
				view [outputfile]
	
	g. Now click on Run and then Run 'VideoEncoderMain' to run the application.
	
	h. Based on the Program arguments, the application will either encode the set of input images to an output file or view the encoded video file in a viewer.
